# Background Motivation
Over the last 100 years, the city of Venice has lost about 9 inches because of its geography and Global warming. As a part of  [Venice Time Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Time_Machine), this project proposes a pipeline to detect building heights of Venice from 2020 Google EThe pipeline allows us to stay on track with the current height information of each building in Venice which can be used as historical data in the future. 
Earth data.
